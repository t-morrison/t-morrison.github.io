ResourceProjects.org is an open data portal for data disclosed by petroleum and mining companies on how much they pay to governments around the world. I have worked on this project at the Natural Resource Governance Institute since 2017, when I created the first version of the data pipeline.

Presently, the data on ResourceProjects.org comes from over 500 companies each year, which publish a project-by-project report on how much they pay in taxes, royalties, fees and more. We collect and standardize this data using R-Shiny apps I developed, designed to extract the data from multiple sources and formats (PDFs, CSVs, etc.) into a single, consistent data structure, and then to clean and standardize the scraped data efficiently and accurately.

In addition to the data pipeline, I lead the website development, where we have focused on making a complex dataset understandable. A major challenge was using space efficiently to present multiple years of disaggregated data.

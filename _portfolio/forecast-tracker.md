This tool came about after a colleague asked for help creating some data visualizations showing the changes in IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts year to year. After the heavy lifting of downloading and wrangling the
data was done, we decided to create this open data app to visualize the hundreds of different countries and indicators worth of forecasts. The tool gets updated as new data is published twice a year.

I built the application in R-Shiny. It uses the *plotly* package for the interactive visualization. Users can create downloadable gifs, like the one below.

I can easily change the contents of this webpage by saving the rmarkdown file on my computer in the GitHub repo, knitting it to HTML, then syncing my local repository with the remote repository where this page is hosted.

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data.frame(a=1:10, b=rnorm(10, mean=4)), aes(x=a, y=b)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  ggtitle("A plot")
```

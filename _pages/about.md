Welcome to my online portfolio. I am currently a Research & Data Officer with the Natural Resources Governance Institute, a global think tank working to improve development outcomes in resource rich countries.

My work spans the whole open data environment: creating open data resources; building tools, websites and visualizations for people to interact with data; and working with experts to utilize data in new and powerful ways.

You'll find examples of my work here, both professionally and personally. I've been working with data for over five years and am always interested in finding and learning the best tool for the job. My go-tos are R and 
R-Shiny.
